# Development of Ilford Delta 400 Film

This page describes the development process of Ilford Delta 400 film with
the following chemicals:

- **Developer**: Ilford Ilfosol 3 [product info](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/1131778)
- **Stop bath**: Ilford Ilfostop [product info](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/1893870)
- **Fix bath**: Ilford RapidFixer [product info](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/rapid-fixer-product)


## Dilutions

### Development
Dilution ratio: **1 + 9**
   
The following dilutions are for 300 ml of development:  
**30 ml Ilfosol 3 + 270 ml water**

### Stop Bath
Dilution ratio: **1 + 19**

The following dilutions are for 300 ml of diluted stop bath:  
**15 ml Ilfostop + 287 ml water**

### Fix Bath
Dilution ratio: **1 + 4**

The following dilutions are for 300 ml of fix bath:  
**75 ml RapidFixer + 225 ml water**

## Process Times
I followed the time suggested by [digitaltruth.com](digitaltruth.com) for 
the development of the Ilford Delta 400. It is important to notice that the 
officiel times provided by Ilford are quite different but I did not felt very
confortable with their very short inversion times.
The following process times are related to a a temperature of **20Â°C**.

### Development
Total time: **7 minutes**
- 1 minute inversions
- 1 minute rest
Then repeat 5 times:
- 10 seconds inversions
- 50 seconds rest

10/15 seconds before the end of time begin pouring the solution out of the tank and 
prepare to fill with the stop bath.

### Stop Bath
Total time: **1 minute**  
Continuously invert in the minute, then emtpy the tank and refill with 
the Fix Bath

### Fix Bath
Total time: **5 minutes**
- 1 minute inversions
- 1 minute rest
Then repeat 3 times:
- 10 seconds inversions
- 50 seconds rest

At the end of the fix bath empty the tank and prepare for the final washing

### Water washing
Total time: **10 minutes**  
Put the tank under running water (tap water) to remove all the residual of 
chemicals.
When the 10 minutes are elapsed open the tank and wash the spiral in 
demineralized water to help remove the residual of limestone, (which has very
high concetrations in the tap water of my zone).

### Film Dry
Gently remove the film from the spiral and use the water removal tool to 
remove water drops from the film.
Hang the film with the clips and let it completely dry.
